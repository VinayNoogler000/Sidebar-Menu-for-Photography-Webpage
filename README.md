# Sidebar-Menu-For-Photography-Webpage

I'm delighted to announce the successful completion of my first project as a software developer, which is a mini-project â€“ a moment I had eagerly anticipated. This project embodies the fusion of theoretical knowledge and practical application.

In this project, I crafted a sleek sidebar menu designed for a photography website.

I utilized HTML and CSS technologies to create this feature, ensuring a user-friendly experience and seamless navigation.

I built the project's sidebar menu using basic HTML tags and CSS properties. I used a clever 'checkbox' switch that acts like a button to control the menu. There are two labels: one with a 'bars' icon to show the menu, and another with an 'X' icon to hide it. CSS makes the magic happen. Clicking the icons moves the menu in and out. That's how I made the core of the project work.
